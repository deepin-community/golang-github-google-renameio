Description: provides a way to atomically create or replace a file or symbolic link
 The renameio Go package provides a way to atomically create or replace a
 file or symbolic link.
 .
 Atomicity vs durability: renameio concerns itself only with atomicity,
 i.e. making sure applications never see unexpected file content
 (a half-written file, or a 0-byte file).
 .
 As a practical example, consider https://manpages.debian.org/: if there
 is a power outage while the site is updating, we are okay with losing the
 manpages which were being rendered at the time of the power outage. They
 will be added in a later run of the software. We are not okay with having
 a manpage replaced by a 0-byte file under any circumstances, though.
